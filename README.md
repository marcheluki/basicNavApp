# 🚀 Basic Navigation App

Welcome to the **Basic Navigation App** I made! This guide will help you get started with setting up the project, installing the necessary tools, and running the application locally on your machine.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

### 1. 🌐 Node.js

Node.js is required to run this project. If you don't have Node.js installed, follow these steps:

- 📥 Download the latest version of Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- 🛠️ Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- ✅ Once installed, verify the installation by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

You should see the versions of Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) printed in the terminal.

### 2. ⚙️ Expo CLI

Expo CLI is a command-line tool that helps you develop, build, and manage your Expo projects.

- 🚀 Install Expo CLI globally on your system using npm:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

- ✅ Verify the installation by running:

```bash
expo --version
```

### 3. 📱 Expo Go App (For Mobile Testing)

To test your app on a physical device, you'll need the Expo Go app:

- [📥 Download Expo Go for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) from the Google Play Store.
- [📥 Download Expo Go for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779) from the Apple App Store.

## 🛠️ Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

### 1. 🖥️ Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcheluki/basicNavApp.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd basicNavMarce
```

### 2. 📦 Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies for the project by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

### 3. ▶️ Running the Project

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
expo start
```

This will open a new browser window with the Expo Developer Tools. From here, you can:

- 📱 Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device to run the app on your phone.
- 🅰️ Press `a` to run the app on an Android emulator.
- 🅸 Press `i` to run the app on an iOS simulator (macOS only).

### 4. 🧪 Testing the App

To test the app:

- **On a physical device:** Use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code generated by `expo start`.
- **On a simulator/emulator:** Follow the prompts in the terminal after running `expo start`.

### 5. 🏗️ Building the App (Optional)

If you want to build the app for production:

```bash
expo build:android
expo build:ios
```

Follow the instructions provided by Expo to generate the build files.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- **(app):** Contains all the pages and components for your app.
